# How to deploy

This file describes the steps to deploy a new version of InLoco into MPRJ servers.

1. Run `npm build`
1. Copy the contents of the `static` to a temporary folder. Name it `inloco`.
1. Zip that folder, so you'll have a file `inloco.zip`.
1. Copy that file to `X:\[Homologacao\Estatico]|Produção`
1. Open a GLPI (or ask someone to do it).
